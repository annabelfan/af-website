She shows incredible leadership, combined with deep knowledge in her field and a great curiosity for new subjects. She is always focused, motivated, and able to tackle, organize, and prioritize problems in creative ways that lead to present and deliver high-quality professional results. She was not only providing great specialist knowledge but at the same time she was doing an amazing job with the UI (User Interface), ticket resolutions, new features, and useful feedback to the team, which eventually lead to present one of the best projects in the course. I am thankful for having met Annabel, and I'm sure she will continue to transcend and go beyond expectations in her future endeavors."
